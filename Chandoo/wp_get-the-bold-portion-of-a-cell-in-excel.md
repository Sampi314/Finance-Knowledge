Ever need to extract just the bold portion of some cells automatically? You can use my **getBoldText** VBA custom function to do that. This function takes a cell and returns the bold portion if any. See these sample results:

![Get the bold text from cells using Excel](https://chandoo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/get-bold-text-excel.png)

Using Custom Functions in Excel
-------------------------------

To extract the bold text from cells, we are going to use User Defined Function (UDF)  feature of Excel.

This feature let’s us build custom functionality that is not part of Excel. 

1.  **Step 1:** Go to Visual Basic Editor (Press ALT+F11 or click on Developer Ribbon > Visual Basic)
2.  **Step 2:** Right on your workbook in the left-hand panel and insert a new module (refer to below illustration).

![](https://chandoo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNAG-3205.png)

Add the getBoldText() Code to your workbook
-------------------------------------------

In the module, copy paste below code.

				
					`Function getBoldText(fromthis As Range) As String     Dim i As Integer, size As Integer     Dim output As String          size = fromthis.Characters.Count          If fromthis.Font.FontStyle Like "Bold*" Then         output = fromthis.Value              Else         For i = 1 To size             If fromthis.Characters(i, 1).Font.FontStyle Like "Bold*" Then                 output = output & fromthis.Characters(i, 1).Caption             End If         Next i     End If     getBoldText = output End Function`
				
			

Save your workbook (as .XLSM file).

Now, you can use =getBoldText() function in your file to extract the bold values from any cell contents.

How to use this function?
-------------------------

Save your workbook (as .XLSM file).

Now, you can use =getBoldText() function in your file to extract the bold values from any cell contents.

The syntax is:

**\=getBoldText(cell\_address)**

See this quick demo to understand how to use the function.

How to install this function so it works in all files?
------------------------------------------------------

You can also install this function [using your _**personal macros workbook.**_](https://chandoo.org/wp/using-personal-macro-workbook/)

Follow below process:

1.  Click on “Excel Add-ins” button in either Developer Ribbon or Options > Add-ins > Excel Add-ins > Go
2.  Enable “Personal” macro workbook. This is a macro file that let’s you store reusable macros & custom functions like getBoldText.
3.  Now go to Visual Basic Editor (ALT+F11) and locate the _personal_ macro file. It would be named personal.xlam
4.  Expand the file and add a module if necessary.
5.  Copy paste the VBA code for getBoldText into this module.
6.  Save and restart Excel.
7.  Now, you should be able to use the getBoldText across any of your workbooks (on your computer).

Known issues and bugs
---------------------

In my preliminary testing this function worked fine in Excel 365. I have not tested it in older versions of Excel like 2013 or 2010. If you notice any bugs or issues please report using the comments feature on this page.

    What about the opposite? I want a list of products without sales or customers with no orders. So I would exclude the ones that are on the other table.

        Good question. You can check for the =0 as countifs result. for example,  
        \=FILTER(orders, COUNTIFS(products, orders\[Product\])=0)  
        should work in this case.
        
        PS: I have added this example to the article now.

    Hi there!
    
    Could i check if there was a way to return certain fields of the table only?
    
    so based off your example above, i would like to continue to use the 'Products" table as a way to filter out items from my "Orders" table, but only want to show maybe only the "Product" and "Order Value" fields, rather than all 5 fields (sales person, customer, product, date, order value).
