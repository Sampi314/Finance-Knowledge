![Merge cells without loosing values - Excel](https://chandoo.org/img/vba/merge-cells-without-loosing-values.png)Many of us face this problem.

**We have some data in a few cells. Either for alignment or structure, we would like to merge the cell contents in to one big cell.** But Excel wont help as it cannot merge values from all cells.

_**Aparna**_ writes,

That got me thinking, _there should be a way to merge cells without losing data?!?_

**Of course there is.** You can use simple features in Excel to do this with ease.

1.  ![Merge cells without loosing data - how to in Excel](https://chandoo.org/img/vba/merge-cells-without-loosing-data.gif) Select all the cells where your data is. (All the cells need to be in one area in one column).
2.  Adjust the column width so that you can fit all contents in one cell. (basically make it wide enough)
3.  **Select Home Ribbon > Fill > Justify**
4.  Merge cells now.

**That is all. The text from selected cells will be magically re-arranged in top-most cell.** If you see the text spreading 2 rows, just make the column wider and repeat the process.

See this simple animation aside to understand how it works.

But wait, this technique has some limitations,

1.  It doesnt work if the selected cells have numbers or formulas
2.  It only works for cells in a single column, if the cells are spread across several columns, justify will not work.
3.  It requires a lot of steps.

_Shouldn’t there be a better way to merge cells without losing data?!?_

**Of course there is,** You can write a simple macro to do this job for you.

For eg. here is the **JoinAndMerge()** macro I have written that works for pretty much all types of data.

Sub JoinAndMerge()  
‘joins all the content in selected cells  
‘and puts the resulting text in top most cell  
‘then merges all cells

Dim outputText As String  
Const delim = ” “

On Error Resume Next

For Each cell In Selection  
outputText = outputText & cell.Value & delim  
Next cell  
With Selection  
.Clear  
.Cells(1).Value = outputText  
.Merge  
.HorizontalAlignment = xlGeneral  
.VerticalAlignment = xlCenter  
.WrapText = True  
End With  
End Sub

[**Download the VBA Code Module**](https://img.chandoo.org/vba/joinandmerge.bas "JoinAndMerge VBA Macro to join cell contents and Merge the cells")

Just copy this code in to a new module or add it your personal macros workbook. And you can use it to quickly merge cells without loosing data. Simple.

The code is easy to figure out if you know basic VBA. So I will not go in to detail.

    What about the opposite? I want a list of products without sales or customers with no orders. So I would exclude the ones that are on the other table.

        Good question. You can check for the =0 as countifs result. for example,  
        \=FILTER(orders, COUNTIFS(products, orders\[Product\])=0)  
        should work in this case.
        
        PS: I have added this example to the article now.

    Hi there!
    
    Could i check if there was a way to return certain fields of the table only?
    
    so based off your example above, i would like to continue to use the 'Products" table as a way to filter out items from my "Orders" table, but only want to show maybe only the "Product" and "Order Value" fields, rather than all 5 fields (sales person, customer, product, date, order value).
