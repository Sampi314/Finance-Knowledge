Summary
-------

To retrieve a value on a specific date from a table, you can use the VLOOKUP function.

In the example shown, the formula in F6 is:

    =VLOOKUP(E6,B6:C11,2,0)
    

Generic formula
---------------

    =VLOOKUP(date,table,col,FALSE)

Explanation 
------------

This is a standard VLOOKUP formula. It requires a table with lookup values (in this case, dates) to the left of the values being retrieved.

The lookup value comes from cell E6, which must be a valid date. The table array is the range B6:C11, and the column index is 2, since the amounts are in the second column of the table. Finally, zero is provided for the final argument to force an exact match.

The VLOOKUP function locates the date value for Sept 4, and returns the value at the same row in the second column: 12,500.

Note: the lookup value and the date values in the table must be valid Excel dates.

### [VLOOKUP without #N/A error](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-without-na-error)

When VLOOKUP can't find a value in a lookup table, it returns the #N/A error. In this example, the goal is to remove the #N/A error that VLOOKUP returns when it can't find a lookup value. In general, the best way to do this is to use the IFNA function. However, the IFERROR function can also be used...

### [Merge tables with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/merge-tables-with-vlookup)

This is a standard "exact match" VLOOKUP formula with one exception: the column index is calculated using the COLUMN function. When the COLUMN function is used without any arguments, it returns a number that corresponds to the current column. In this case, the first instance of the formula in...

### [VLOOKUP two-way lookup](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-two-way-lookup)

In this example, the goal is to perform a two-way lookup based on the name in cell H4 and the month in cell H5 with the VLOOKUP function. Inside the VLOOKUP function, the column index argument is normally hard-coded as a static number. However, you can create a dynamic column index number by using...

### [VLOOKUP calculate grades](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-calculate-grades)

In this example, the goal is to calculate the correct grade for each name in column B using the score in column C and the table in F5:G9 as a "key" to assign grades. For convenience only, the range F5:G9 has been named key . This is a classic "approximate-match" lookup problem because it is not...

### [Get employee information with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-employee-information-with-vlookup)

The goal is to look up and retrieve employee information in a table that contains unique id values in the first column. The VLOOKUP function is straightforward to use with data in this format, but you can easily use the XLOOKUP function as well. See below for a detailed explanation of both...

### [How to use VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/videos/how-to-use-vlookup)

VLOOKUP is one of the most important lookup functions in Excel. The V stands for "vertical" which means you can use VLOOKUP to look up values in a table that's arranged vertically. Let's take a look. Here we have a list of employees in a table. Let's use VLOOKUP to build a simple form that...

You might build or inherit a worksheet that uses a series of nested IF statements to assign values of some kind.

### [How to use VLOOKUP for approximate matches](https://exceljet.net/videos/how-to-use-vlookup-for-approximate-matches)

In a lot of cases, you'll use VLOOKUP to find exact matches based on some kind of unique id, but there are many situations where you'll want to use VLOOKUP to find non-exact matches. A classic case is using VLOOKUP to find a commission rate based on a sales number. Let's take a look. Here we have...
