Summary
-------

If you have a list of products or services (or related options), with associated costs, you can use VLOOKUP to find and retrieve the cost for a specific option.

In the example shown, the formula in cell F6 is:

    =VLOOKUP(E6,B5:C7,2,FALSE)
    

This formula uses the value of cell E6 to lookup and retrieve the right cost in the range B5:C7.

Generic formula
---------------

    =VLOOKUP(product,table,column,FALSE)

Explanation 
------------

This is a basic example of VLOOKUP in "exact match" mode. The lookup value is B6, the table is the range B5:C7, the column is 2, and the last argument, FALSE, forces VLOOKUP to do an exact match. (Read why this is necessary [here](https://exceljet.net/articles/danger-beware-vlookup-defaults)
).

If VLOOKUP finds a matching value, the associated cost will be retrieved from the 2nd column (column C). If no match is found, VLOOKUP will return the #N/A error.

### [VLOOKUP without #N/A error](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-without-na-error)

When VLOOKUP can't find a value in a lookup table, it returns the #N/A error. In this example, the goal is to remove the #N/A error that VLOOKUP returns when it can't find a lookup value. In general, the best way to do this is to use the IFNA function. However, the IFERROR function can also be used...

### [VLOOKUP two-way lookup](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-two-way-lookup)

In this example, the goal is to perform a two-way lookup based on the name in cell H4 and the month in cell H5 with the VLOOKUP function. Inside the VLOOKUP function, the column index argument is normally hard-coded as a static number. However, you can create a dynamic column index number by using...

### [VLOOKUP calculate grades](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-calculate-grades)

In this example, the goal is to calculate the correct grade for each name in column B using the score in column C and the table in F5:G9 as a "key" to assign grades. For convenience only, the range F5:G9 has been named key . This is a classic "approximate-match" lookup problem because it is not...

This is a standard "exact match" VLOOKUP formula with one exception: the column index is calculated using the COLUMN function. When the COLUMN function is used without any arguments, it returns a number that corresponds to the current column. In this case, the first instance of the formula in...

VLOOKUP is one of the most important lookup functions in Excel. The V stands for "vertical" which means you can use VLOOKUP to look up values in a table that's arranged vertically. Let's take a look. Here we have a list of employees in a table. Let's use VLOOKUP to build a simple form that...

### [How to use VLOOKUP for approximate matches](https://exceljet.net/videos/how-to-use-vlookup-for-approximate-matches)

In a lot of cases, you'll use VLOOKUP to find exact matches based on some kind of unique id, but there are many situations where you'll want to use VLOOKUP to find non-exact matches. A classic case is using VLOOKUP to find a commission rate based on a sales number. Let's take a look. Here we have...
