Summary
-------

To highlight duplicate values in two or more columns, you can use conditional formatting with on a formula based on the COUNTIF and AND functions.

In the example shown, the formula used to highlight duplicate values is:

    =AND(COUNTIF(range1,B5),COUNTIF(range2,B5))
    

Both ranges were selected at the same when the rule was created.

Generic formula
---------------

    =AND(COUNTIF(range1,A1),COUNTIF(range2,A1))

Explanation 
------------

This formula uses two named ranges, "range1" (B5:B12) and "range2" (D5:D10).

The core of this formula is the COUNTIF function, which returns a count of each value in both range inside the AND function:

    COUNTIF(range1,B5) // count in range1
    COUNTIF(range2,B5) // count in range2
    

COUNTIF will either return zero (evaluated as FALSE) or a positive number (evaluated as TRUE) for each value in both ranges.

If both counts are positive (i.e. non-zero), the AND function will return TRUE and trigger the conditional format.

### [Highlight duplicate values](https://exceljet.net/formulas/highlight-duplicate-values)

COUNTIF simply counts the number of times each value appears in the range. When the count is more than 1, the formula returns TRUE and triggers the rule. When you use a formula to apply conditional formatting, the formula is evaluated relative to the active cell in the selection at the time the...

### [Highlight duplicate rows](https://exceljet.net/formulas/highlight-duplicate-rows)

In the formula, COUNTIFS counts the number of times each value in a cell appears in its "parent" column. By definition, each value must appear at least once, so when the count > 1, the value must be a duplicate. The references are carefully locked so the formula will return true only when all 3...

### [Range contains duplicates](https://exceljet.net/formulas/range-contains-duplicates)

In this example, the goal is to test if a given range contains duplicate values and return TRUE if duplicates exist and FALSE if not. This is essentially a counting problem and the solution is based on the COUNTIF function , which counts values in a range that meet supplied criteria. The formula...

### [COUNTIF Function](https://exceljet.net/functions/countif-function)

The Excel COUNTIF function returns the count of cells in a range that meet a single condition. The generic syntax is COUNTIF(range, criteria), where "range" contains the cells to count, and "criteria" is a condition that must be true for a cell to be counted. COUNTIF can be used to count...
