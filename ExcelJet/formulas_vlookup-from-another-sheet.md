Summary
-------

Using VLOOKUP from another sheet is very similar to using VLOOKUP on the same sheet. In the example shown, the formula in F5 is:

    =VLOOKUP(B5,Sheet2!$B$5:$C$104,2,0)
    

VLOOKUP retrieves the correct building for each employee from Sheet2 into the table on Sheet1.

Generic formula
---------------

    =VLOOKUP(lookup,sheet!range,column,match)

Explanation 
------------

In this example, we have a table of employee locations like this on Sheet2:

![We use VLOOKUP to lookup each person's building from Sheet2](https://exceljet.net/sites/default/files/styles/original_with_watermark/public/images/formulas/inline/VLOOKUP%20from%20another%20sheet%20building%20list.png?itok=gUu033ke "We use VLOOKUP to lookup each person's building from Sheet2")

On Sheet1, we retrieve the building location for each team member using this formula:

    =VLOOKUP(B5,Sheet2!$B$5:$C$104,2,0)
    

The lookup value is the employee ID, from cell B5.

For the table array, we use the range $B$5:$C$104 qualified with a sheet name, and locked as an [absolute reference](https://exceljet.net/glossary/absolute-reference)
, so that the range does not change as the formula is copied down:

    Sheet2!$B$5:$C$104 // includes sheet name
    

This is the only difference from a normal VLOOKUP formula – the sheet name simply tells VLOOKUP where to find the lookup table range, B5:C104.

Finally, column number is 2, since the building names appear in the second column, and VLOOKUP is set to exact match mode by including zero (0) as the last argument. This ensures that we get the correct building for each team member and a #N/A error if for some reason the id is not found in the location table.

### [VLOOKUP from another workbook](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-from-another-workbook)

In this example, the goal is to use VLOOKUP to find and retrieve price information for a given product stored in an external Excel workbook. The workbook exists in the same directory and the data in the file looks like this: Note the data itself is in the range B5:E13. VLOOKUP formula The formula...

### [Get employee information with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-employee-information-with-vlookup)

The goal is to look up and retrieve employee information in a table that contains unique id values in the first column. The VLOOKUP function is straightforward to use with data in this format, but you can easily use the XLOOKUP function as well. See below for a detailed explanation of both...

### [Merge tables with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/merge-tables-with-vlookup)

This is a standard "exact match" VLOOKUP formula with one exception: the column index is calculated using the COLUMN function. When the COLUMN function is used without any arguments, it returns a number that corresponds to the current column. In this case, the first instance of the formula in...

### [VLOOKUP two-way lookup](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-two-way-lookup)

In this example, the goal is to perform a two-way lookup based on the name in cell H4 and the month in cell H5 with the VLOOKUP function. Inside the VLOOKUP function, the column index argument is normally hard-coded as a static number. However, you can create a dynamic column index number by using...

### [VLOOKUP calculate grades](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-calculate-grades)

In this example, the goal is to calculate the correct grade for each name in column B using the score in column C and the table in F5:G9 as a "key" to assign grades. For convenience only, the range F5:G9 has been named key . This is a classic "approximate-match" lookup problem because it is not...

### [VLOOKUP without #N/A error](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-without-na-error)

When VLOOKUP can't find a value in a lookup table, it returns the #N/A error. In this example, the goal is to remove the #N/A error that VLOOKUP returns when it can't find a lookup value. In general, the best way to do this is to use the IFNA function. However, the IFERROR function can also be used...

### [Dynamic worksheet reference](https://exceljet.net/formulas/dynamic-worksheet-reference)

The INDIRECT function tries to evaluate text as a worksheet reference. This makes it possible to build formulas that assemble a reference as text using concatenation , and use the resulting text as a valid reference. In this example, we have Sheet names in column B, so we join the sheet name to the...
