Summary
-------

To test a cell for one of many strings, while excluding others, you can use a formula based on the SEARCH, ISNUMBER, and SUMPRODUCT functions. In the example shown the formula in C5 is:

    =(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(include,B5)))>0)
    *(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(exclude,B5)))=0)
    

where "include" is the [named range](https://exceljet.net/glossary/named-range)
 E5:E9, and "exclude" is the named range G5:G6.

Generic formula
---------------

    =(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(include,A1)))>0)
    *(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(exclude,A1)))=0)

Explanation 
------------

At the core, this formula uses the SEARCH function to look for multiple strings inside a cell. Inside the left SUMPRODUCT, SEARCH looks for all strings in the named range "include".

In the right SUMPRODUCT, SEARCH looks for all strings in the named range "exclude".

In both parts of the formula, SEARCH returns numeric positions when strings are found, and errors when not. The ISNUMBER function converts the numbers to TRUE and errors to FALSE, and the [double negative](https://exceljet.net/articles/the-double-negative-in-excel-formulas)
 converts the TRUE FALSE values to 1 and 0.

The result at this point looks like this:

    =(SUMPRODUCT({1;0;0;0;0})>0)*(SUMPRODUCT({0;0})=0)
    

Then:

    =(1>0)*(0=0)
    =TRUE*TRUE
    =1
    

_Note: this formula returns either 1 or zero, which are handled like TRUE and FALSE in formulas, conditional formatting, or data validation._

### [Cell contains one of many things](https://exceljet.net/formulas/cell-contains-one-of-many-things)

The goal of this example is to test each cell in B5:B14 to see if it contains any of the strings in the named range things (E5:E7). These strings can appear anywhere in the cell, so this is a literal "contains" problem. The formula in C5, copied down, is: =SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(things,B5)))...

### [Cell contains all of many things](https://exceljet.net/formulas/cell-contains-all-of-many-things)

In this example, the goal is to build a formula that will return TRUE if a given cell contains all values that appear in a given range. We could build a formula that uses nested IF statements to check for each value, but that won't scale well if we have a lot of values to test because each new...

### [Get first match cell contains](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-first-match-cell-contains)

The general goal is to search through a cell for one of several specified values and return the first match found if one exists. The worksheet includes a list of colors in the range E5:E11 (which is named list ) and a series of short sentences in the range B5:B16. The task is to add a formula in...

### [Value exists in a range](https://exceljet.net/formulas/value-exists-in-a-range)

In this example, the goal is to use a formula to check if a specific value exists in a range. The easiest way to do this is to use the COUNTIF function to count occurrences of a value in a range, then use the count to create a final result.

### [Get all matches cell contains](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-all-matches-cell-contains)

In this example the goal is to check a cell for several things at once, and return a comma separated list of the things that were found. In other words, we want check for the colors seen in column E and list the colors found in column C. The formula in C5, copied down, is: =TEXTJOIN(", ",1,FILTER(...
