Summary
-------

To make a self-contained lookup formula, you can use an [array constant](https://exceljet.net/glossary/array-constant)
 inside of the [VLOOKUP function](https://exceljet.net/functions/vlookup-function)
. In the example shown, the formula in F7 is:

    =VLOOKUP(E7,{0,"F";60,"D";70,"C";80,"B";90,"A"},2,TRUE)
    

This formula assigns a grade to the score in cell E7 based on the table seen in B6:C10, but the table used for the lookup is hard-coded into the formula.

Generic formula
---------------

    =VLOOKUP(lookup,{table_array},column,match)
    

Explanation 
------------

The goal in this example is to create a self-contained lookup formula to assign a grade to the score in cell E7, based on the table in B6:C10. However, instead of providing B6:B10 as a reference for the _table\_array_ argument, the table is provided as a _constant_.

Normally, the second argument for VLOOKUP is provided as a range like B6:C10:

    =VLOOKUP(E7,B6:C10,2,TRUE)
    

When the formula is evaluated, the reference B6:C10 is converted internally to a two-dimensional [array](https://exceljet.net/glossary/array)
 like this:

    {0,"F";60,"D";70,"C";80,"B";90,"A"}
    

Each comma indicates a column, and each semi-colon indicates a row. Knowing this, when a table is small, you can convert the table to an "[array constant](https://exceljet.net/glossary/array-constant)
" and use the constant inside VLOOKUP, instead of the reference. In the example  shown, the formula used is:

    =VLOOKUP(E7,{0,"F";60,"D";70,"C";80,"B";90,"A"},2,TRUE)
    

This formula is functionally the same as the "standard" form above. However, the advantage is that you no longer need to maintain a table on the worksheet. The disadvantage is that the array is hard-coded into the formula. If you copy the formula to more than one cell, you will have to maintain more than one instance of the array constant. Editing an array constant is more difficult than editing a table on the worksheet, and other users may not understand the formula. Nonetheless, there are situations where a self-contained lookup formula is handy.

### Creating an array constant

If the array constant is simple like {"a","b","c"} it is easy to type manually. However, two-dimensional tables have a more complex syntax. An easy to create an array constant it to flow these steps:

1.  In an empty cell, type "=".
2.  Select the range you want to covert (don't include the headers).
3.  In the formula bar, type F9 to "evaluate" the range.
4.  Excel will convert the range reference into an array constant.
5.  Copy the array constant (don't include the =) and paste it into your formula.

### Named range option

Another way to avoid placing a table on the worksheet is to create a [named range](https://exceljet.net/articles/named-ranges)
 using the array constant as the value, then refer to the named range in VLOOKUP for the table array. This way, the table doesn't need to appear on a worksheet, and there is only one instance of the table in the workbook to maintain.

### Creating the array constant

To create an array constant for a range, start by entering the table normally on the worksheet. Then, in an empty cell, start a formula with the equal sign (=) and select the range that contains the table. Then [use the shortcut F9](https://exceljet.net/videos/how-to-check-and-debug-a-formula-with-f9)
 to convert the reference to an array constant, and copy to the clipboard. You can then paste the table into a formula as a constant.

### [VLOOKUP calculate grades](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-calculate-grades)

In this example, the goal is to calculate the correct grade for each name in column B using the score in column C and the table in F5:G9 as a "key" to assign grades. For convenience only, the range F5:G9 has been named key . This is a classic "approximate-match" lookup problem because it is not...

In this example, the goal is to perform a two-way lookup based on the name in cell H4 and the month in cell H5 with the VLOOKUP function. Inside the VLOOKUP function, the column index argument is normally hard-coded as a static number. However, you can create a dynamic column index number by using...

### [Get employee information with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-employee-information-with-vlookup)

The goal is to look up and retrieve employee information in a table that contains unique id values in the first column. The VLOOKUP function is straightforward to use with data in this format, but you can easily use the XLOOKUP function as well. See below for a detailed explanation of both...

### [VLOOKUP without #N/A error](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-without-na-error)

When VLOOKUP can't find a value in a lookup table, it returns the #N/A error. In this example, the goal is to remove the #N/A error that VLOOKUP returns when it can't find a lookup value. In general, the best way to do this is to use the IFNA function. However, the IFERROR function can also be used...
