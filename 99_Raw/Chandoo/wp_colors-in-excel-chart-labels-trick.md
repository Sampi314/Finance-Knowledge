_This post is part of our [spreadcheats series](http://chandoo.org/wp/tag/spreadcheats/)
 – 30 Excel and Charting Tips & Hacks aimed to make day to day spreadsheeting fun and productive._

One of the most common charts is “YoY Growth Rates of Our Superawesomekickass Product”. While not everyone may have a superawesomekickass product, most of us in fact make a YoY (Year on Year) growth rate charts for various types of data.

**A simple label formatting hack can improve the effectiveness of these charts by adding color to differentiate positive vs. negative growth** (or mediocre vs. sky rocketing growth rates). See this example:

![Excel Chart - Colors in Data Labels - How to](https://chandoo.org/img/a/chart-label-formatting-trick.png)

You can get this effect by applying custom number formatting to the data label. It is one of my favorite tricks in excel and I have written about it in [introduction to custom cell formatting in excel](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/02/25/custom-cell-formatting-in-excel-few-tips-tricks/)
, [number formatting in excel using custom codes](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/06/16/formatting-numbers-in-excel-few-tips/)
, [showing decimal values only when needed](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/10/02/excel-number-formatting-tip-showing-decimals-conditionally/)
 articles.

### How you can get colors in Axis Labels

First apply data labels to your chart and now select the data labels and press ctrl+1 (aww, come on now, you are reading this blog, you should [what ctrl+1 means](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/11/26/say-thanks-with-an-excel-tip/)
) and go to numbers tab. Select “custom” as category and specify the formatting code like this:

![custom format code for getting colors in chart labels](https://chandoo.org/img/a/custom-format-axis-label.png)

**`[blue]+0%;[red]-0%`**

Now, that was easy, isn’t it. But you might think, “Chandoo, what the heck the above format code is doing?”

Well, it tells excel to apply red color and add a minus symbol if the data label value is less than zero and apply blue color and add + symbol if the value is above zero. You see the custom number formatting codes have 3 parts in them, like this:

`formatting for positive numbers ; formatting for negative numbers ; formatting for zero values`

If you are noob (_hi noob!_) and lost in all these codes and square brackets, you may want to checkout our post on [introduction to number formatting in excel](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/02/25/custom-cell-formatting-in-excel-few-tips-tricks/)
 to learn more about custom codes.

### Ok, that was fun, What else you can do?

You can do much more using custom codes to format data labels. For example, **a code like `[Red][<0.15]0%;[Blue][>=0.15]0%;`** will, Oh, forget it, you can guess that. Just _remember that excel allows only 3 parts in custom codes_. So go nuts, but just thrice.

    What about the opposite? I want a list of products without sales or customers with no orders. So I would exclude the ones that are on the other table.

        Good question. You can check for the =0 as countifs result. for example,  
        \=FILTER(orders, COUNTIFS(products, orders\[Product\])=0)  
        should work in this case.
        
        PS: I have added this example to the article now.

    Hi there!
    
    Could i check if there was a way to return certain fields of the table only?
    
    so based off your example above, i would like to continue to use the 'Products" table as a way to filter out items from my "Orders" table, but only want to show maybe only the "Product" and "Order Value" fields, rather than all 5 fields (sales person, customer, product, date, order value).
