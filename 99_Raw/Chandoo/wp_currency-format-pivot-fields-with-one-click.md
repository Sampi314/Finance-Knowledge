**Anyone who has made a pivot table and their grandma knows that formatting them is a pain.** Let’s recap the steps to apply one of the most common formats – _currency format._

1.  Right click on any value field
2.  Go to Value field settings
3.  Click on “Number Format” button
4.  Choose Currency format
5.  Close the boxes, one after another

**Unless you get paid _per click_, you wont be happy with all those clicks.**

Wouldn’t it be cool to just click once and apply most common format to your pivot fields?

![One Click pivot table currency format macro - demo](https://chandoo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/one-click-currency-format-pivot-macro-demo-v1.gif)

Of course you can. Just add _oneClickCurrency_ macro to your [personal macros workbook](http://chandoo.org/wp/2013/11/18/using-personal-macro-workbook/)
. And then [add this to your Home ribbon](http://chandoo.org/wp/2012/02/27/how-to-add-your-own-macros-to-excel-ribbon/)
 as a custom button and you have a one click format option for any pivot.

### oneClickCurrency Macro

So are you ready for the code? Its so tiny, you could type it faster than manually formatting the pivot fields yourself 😉

  

    
    Sub oneClickCurrency()
        On Error GoTo GameOver
        Dim pName As String, pfName As String
        
        pName = ActiveCell.PivotTable.Name
        pfName = ActiveCell.PivotField.Name
        
        With ActiveSheet.PivotTables(pName).PivotFields(pfName)
            .NumberFormat = "$#,##0.00"
        End With
    GameOver:
    End Sub
    

When copy pasting this code to your personal macros workbook, change the $#,##0.00 format code to any other formatting you want to use. Here are a few more common ones.

*   Accounting format (negative values in brackets, no zeros):  \_($\* #,##0.00\_);\_($\* (#,##0.00);\_($\* “”-“”??\_);\_(@\_)
*   Negative amounts in red color: $#,##0.00;\[Red\]$#,##0.00
*   Amounts with no decimals: $#,##0

So there you go. I just save you from a massive tax. _Click tax that is._

Short & fun, that is how I like my macros. Here are a few you should add to your personal macros workbook to save time & get more out of Excel.

### How do you format your pivots?

For most of my work, I rely on Power Pivot, which allows you to set up format options when defining a measure. But whenever I use pivots, I end up paying click tax for the formatting. Hence the macro.

**What about you?** How do you format your pivots? You can customize the above macro to include additional steps that you often do (changing layouts etc.) Please share your techniques & thoughts in the comments section.

    What about the opposite? I want a list of products without sales or customers with no orders. So I would exclude the ones that are on the other table.

        Good question. You can check for the =0 as countifs result. for example,  
        \=FILTER(orders, COUNTIFS(products, orders\[Product\])=0)  
        should work in this case.
        
        PS: I have added this example to the article now.

    Hi there!
    
    Could i check if there was a way to return certain fields of the table only?
    
    so based off your example above, i would like to continue to use the 'Products" table as a way to filter out items from my "Orders" table, but only want to show maybe only the "Product" and "Order Value" fields, rather than all 5 fields (sales person, customer, product, date, order value).
