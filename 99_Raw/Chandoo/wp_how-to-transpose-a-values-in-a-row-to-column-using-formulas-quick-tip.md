_This is interesting,_ I am in Columbus to meet one of my college friends. I remember him as a very meticulous person from college days. So it is no surprise when he showed me his massively impressive _finance tracker_ last night. He has been tracking expenses, income, credit card payments and gas (petrol) consumption since 2008. Very impressive indeed.

Then out of blue he said, he has a problem with his spreadsheet. In this own words,

> When entering data for credit cards, I use one column per card. But in my report view, I want to show credit card details in rows. How do I do this?

**Something like this:**

### Transposing values in a row to column using formulas

If it is a one time process, my friend can [use Paste Special > Transpose feature](http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/11/18/transpose-excel-rows-columns/)
 and be done. But this is no one time business. So lets understand which formula helps us do this.

1.  Lets assume original data is in $F$4:$J$5. Row 4 has card names & Row 5 has amounts.
2.  Wherever you want the out put, just list running numbers (1,2,3….) in a column. Lets say these are in cells D10:D14.
3.  To get the _first_ card name, you can use the formula =INDEX($F$4:$J$4, $D10)
4.  To get the _first_ amount due, use the formula =INDEX($F$5:$J$5, $D10)
5.  Now drag both these formulas down and you are done!

**This is good, but I don’t like the extra column…**

If that is the case, you can use the ROWS() formula to generate these running numbers for you on the fly. For example,

\=INDEX($F$4:$J$4, ROWS($A$1:A1)) would work perfectly.

.

### Play with this formula

See the embedded Excel workbook below. Play with the formula.

### How do you transpose values?

I love [using INDEX formula](http://chandoo.org/wp/tag/index/)
. I use it for transposing values, tables, getting a cell value (or reference) from a large table, use it along with MATCH etc. It is a very versatile formula and I keep learning new uses for it.

What about you? Do you transpose values often? What formulas do you use? **Please share using comments.**

    What about the opposite? I want a list of products without sales or customers with no orders. So I would exclude the ones that are on the other table.

        Good question. You can check for the =0 as countifs result. for example,  
        \=FILTER(orders, COUNTIFS(products, orders\[Product\])=0)  
        should work in this case.
        
        PS: I have added this example to the article now.

    Hi there!
    
    Could i check if there was a way to return certain fields of the table only?
    
    so based off your example above, i would like to continue to use the 'Products" table as a way to filter out items from my "Orders" table, but only want to show maybe only the "Product" and "Order Value" fields, rather than all 5 fields (sales person, customer, product, date, order value).
