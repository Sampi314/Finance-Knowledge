Summary
-------

If you need to extract the first word from some text you can use a formula that uses the FIND and LEFT functions. From the example, the formula looks like this:

    =LEFT(B4,FIND(" ",B4)-1)
    

Generic formula
---------------

    =LEFT(a1,FIND(" ",a1)-1)

Explanation 
------------

FIND returns the position (as a number) of the _first occurrence_ of a space character in the text. This position, minus one, is fed into the LEFT function as _num\_chars_. The LEFT function then extracts characters starting at the _left_ side of the text, up to (position - 1).

### Handling one word

If a cell contains only one word, this formula returns an error. One way to fix this problem is to wrap the original formula in the IFERROR function like so:

    =IFERROR(LEFT(B4,FIND(" ",B4)-1),B4)
    

Translated: if an error occurs, return the original text.

Another simple way to handle the error is to append a space to the cell value before running FIND:

    =LEFT(B4,FIND(" ",B4&" ")-1)
    

This ensures that FIND will always find at least one space, and will therefore not throw an error. When a cell contains more than one word, there is no impact because the formula works only with the _first_ space.

### [Extract word that begins with specific character](https://exceljet.net/formulas/extract-word-that-begins-with-specific-character)

Starting from the inside out, the MID function is used to extract all text after "@": MID(B5,FIND("@",B5),LEN(B5)) The FIND function provides the starting point, and for total characters to extract, we just use LEN on the original text. This is a bit sloppy, but it avoids having to calculate the...

### [Split text string at specific character](https://exceljet.net/formulas/split-text-string-at-specific-character)

In this example, the goal is to split a text string at the underscore("\_") character with a formula. Notice the location of the underscore is different in each row. This means the formula needs to locate the position of the underscore character first before any text is extracted. There are two...

### [Split text with delimiter](https://exceljet.net/formulas/split-text-with-delimiter)

The gist of this formula is to replace a given delimiter with a large number of spaces using SUBSTITUTE and REPT, then use the MID function to extract text related to the "nth occurrence" and the TRIM function to get rid of the extra space. In this snippet, the delimiter ( delim ) is replaced with...
