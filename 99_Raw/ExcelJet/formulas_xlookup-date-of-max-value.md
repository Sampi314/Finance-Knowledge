Summary
-------

To use XLOOKUP to find the date of the max value, you can use the [MAX function](https://exceljet.net/functions/max-function)
 with the [XLOOKUP function](https://exceljet.net/functions/xlookup-function)
. In the example shown, the formula in F4 is:

    =XLOOKUP(MAX(values),values,dates)
    

where **values** (C4:C15) and **dates** (B4:B15) are [named ranges](https://exceljet.net/glossary/named-range)
.

Generic formula
---------------

    =XLOOKUP(MAX(values),values,dates)

Explanation 
------------

This formula is based on the [XLOOKUP function](https://exceljet.net/functions/xlookup-function)
. Working from the inside out, we use the [MAX function](https://exceljet.net/functions/max-function)
 to calculate a lookup value:

    MAX(values)
    

MAX is [nested](https://exceljet.net/glossary/nesting)
 inside XLOOKUP, and returns a value directly as the first argument:

    =XLOOKUP(MAX(values),values,dates)
    

*   The _lookup\_value_ is delivered by MAX
*   The _lookup\_array_ is the [named range](https://exceljet.net/glossary/named-range)
     **values** (C4:C15)
*   The _return\_array_ is the named range **dates** (B4:B15)
*   The _match\_mode_ is not provided and defaults to 0 (exact match)
*   The _search\_mode_ is not provided and defaults to 1 (first to last)

### Without named ranges

The example uses named ranges for convenience and readability. Without named ranges, the same formula is:

    =XLOOKUP(MAX(C4:C15),C4:C15,B4:B15)
    

### Min value

To return the date of the minimum value, the formula in F5 just substitutes the [MIN function](https://exceljet.net/functions/min-function)
 for the MAX function:

    =XLOOKUP(MIN(values),values,dates)
    

### With INDEX and MATCH

The equivalent INDEX and MATCH formula to return the date of max value is:

    =INDEX(dates,MATCH(MAX(values),values,0))
    

_Note: although the example uses a vertical range of data, both formulas above will work just as well with a horizontal range._

### [XLOOKUP with multiple criteria](https://exceljet.net/formulas/xlookup-with-multiple-criteria)

In this example, the goal is to look up a price using XLOOKUP with multiple criteria. To be more specific, we want to look up a price based on Item, Size, and Color.

### [XLOOKUP with logical criteria](https://exceljet.net/formulas/xlookup-with-logical-criteria)

XLOOKUP can handle arrays natively, which makes it a very useful function when constructing criteria based on multiple logical expressions. In the example shown, we are looking for the order number of the first order to Chicago over $250. We are constructing a lookup array using the following...

### [XLOOKUP lookup left](https://exceljet.net/formulas/xlookup-lookup-left)

Whereas VLOOKUP is limited to lookups to the right of the lookup column, XLOOKUP can lookup values to the left natively. This means XLOOKUP can be used instead of INDEX and MATCH to find values to the left in a table or range. In the example shown, we are looking for the weight associated with...
