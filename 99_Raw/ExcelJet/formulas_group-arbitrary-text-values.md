Summary
-------

IF you want to group or classify data based on arbitrary text values, you can use VLOOKUP instead of a long series of nested IF statements.

The trick is to build a custom table that will map values to all the groups you need.

In the example shown, the formula in F5 is:

    =VLOOKUP(E5,key,2,0)
    

Generic formula
---------------

    =VLOOKUP(value,table,column,0)

Explanation 
------------

This formula uses the value in cell E5 for a lookup value, the named range "key" (H5:I9) for the lookup table, 2 to indicate "2nd column", and 0 as the last argument indicate exact match. You can also use FALSE instead of zero if you like.

VLOOKUP simply looks up the value and returns the group name from the 2nd column in the table. Both columns in the table can contain any values that you need, and the table doesn't need to be sorted since VLOOKUP is using exact match.

As always, if VLOOKUP can't find a match, it will return #N/A.

### [Group numbers with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/group-numbers-with-vlookup)

In this example, the goal is to group ages into buckets. One way to do this is to prepare a table with age breakpoints in the first column, and the name of the appropriate group or bucket in the second column. Then use a lookup function to find the right bucket or group for each age. In the example...

### [VLOOKUP calculate grades](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-calculate-grades)

In this example, the goal is to calculate the correct grade for each name in column B using the score in column C and the table in F5:G9 as a "key" to assign grades. For convenience only, the range F5:G9 has been named key . This is a classic "approximate-match" lookup problem because it is not...

### [Get employee information with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/get-employee-information-with-vlookup)

The goal is to look up and retrieve employee information in a table that contains unique id values in the first column. The VLOOKUP function is straightforward to use with data in this format, but you can easily use the XLOOKUP function as well. See below for a detailed explanation of both...

### [Map inputs to arbitrary values](https://exceljet.net/formulas/map-inputs-to-arbitrary-values)

In this example, the goal is to map the numbers 1-6 to the arbitrary values seen in the table below. For example: If the input is 1, the output should be 10 If the input is 2, the output should be 81 If the input is 3, the output should be 17 If the input is 4, the output should be 23 And so on.....

### [VLOOKUP two-way lookup](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-two-way-lookup)

In this example, the goal is to perform a two-way lookup based on the name in cell H4 and the month in cell H5 with the VLOOKUP function. Inside the VLOOKUP function, the column index argument is normally hard-coded as a static number. However, you can create a dynamic column index number by using...

### [Merge tables with VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/formulas/merge-tables-with-vlookup)

This is a standard "exact match" VLOOKUP formula with one exception: the column index is calculated using the COLUMN function. When the COLUMN function is used without any arguments, it returns a number that corresponds to the current column. In this case, the first instance of the formula in...

### [VLOOKUP without #N/A error](https://exceljet.net/formulas/vlookup-without-na-error)

When VLOOKUP can't find a value in a lookup table, it returns the #N/A error. In this example, the goal is to remove the #N/A error that VLOOKUP returns when it can't find a lookup value. In general, the best way to do this is to use the IFNA function. However, the IFERROR function can also be used...
